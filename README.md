# GLinear: A Linear Predictor for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting
This repository is the official Pytorch implementation of GLinear Predictor: "Paper Link".

## Description

## Acknowledgment
This code is built on the code base of LTSF-Linear Predictors (**NLinear**, **DLinear**). We would like to thank the following GitHub repository for their valuable code bases, datasets and detailed descriptions:

[https://github.com/cure-lab/LTSF-Linear](https://github.com/cure-lab/LTSF-Linear)

Required Environment and libraries can be installed using instructions given in above link. 

Furthermore, we would also like to thank the pytorch implementation of **RLinear** predictor used for comparative analysis, available at:
[https://github.com/plumprc/RTSF/blob/main/models/RLinear.py](https://github.com/plumprc/RTSF/blob/main/models/RLinear.py)

## Training the GLinear and Other Predictors:

First, create the conda environment and install the required tools and libraries, as follows:

```
conda create -n GLinear python=3.6.9
conda activate GLinear
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Datasets
All processed datasets are in the ./dataset directory

### Use Following Command to Train Linear Predictors for Varying LookBack Windows: 
```bash scripts/EXP-LookBackWindow_\&_LongForecasting/Linear_LookBackWindow.sh```

### Use Following Command to Train Linear Predictors for Varying Prediction Lengths: 
```bash scripts/EXP-LookBackWindow_\&_LongForecasting/Linear_LongForecasting.sh```

### Results
All the results will be shown in ./logs directory
